However, actually working with and/or creating a project requires going through both a Workspace and a Scene object instance as well.\n\nOn the main thread object list created by default when the proxy interface is first initialized through one of the proxy APIs, a default project instance is created.\nThe following code samples illustrate how to get to that default project object in various languages.\n\nC++:\n<pre><code>#include 'HueSpace3/Workspace.h'\n#include 'HueSpace3/SceneManager.h'\n#include 'HueSpace3/ProjectManager.h'\nauto project = Hue::ProxyLib::Workspace::Instance()->Scenes()[0]->Projects()[0];</pre></code>\n\nPython:\n<pre><code>import hue\nproject = hue.Workspace.instance().scenes[0].projects[0]</pre></code>\n\nIt is possible to access the proxy API on multiple threads and to work with multiple object lists on the same thread or across threads. In cases other than the one described above (i.e., other than the main thread object list created by default when the proxy interface is first initialized through one of the proxy APIs), a singleton Workspace instance will always be accessible, but a default Scene and Project will not be created. Instead, they must be explicitly created as needed. The following code samples illustrate how to create a Project object in various languages.\n\nC++:\n<pre><code>#include 'HueSpace3/Workspace.h'\n#include 'HueSpace3/SceneManager.h'\n#include 'HueSpace3/ProjectManager.h'\nauto scene = Hue::ProxyLib::Workspace::Instance()->Scenes().Create();\nauto project = scene->Projects().Create();</pre></code>\n\nPython:\n<pre><code>import hue\nscene = hue.Workspace.instance().scenes.createScene()\nproject = scene.projects.createProject()</pre></code>\n\nIt is possible to create multiple scenes and projects (by using the <code>Create()</code>-methods on the object managers).\nHaving multiple project instances in an application can be useful for scoping and isolation of objects, e.g., a viewer-type application might allow for opening multiple datasets, each of which is placed in a separate project, along with visualization objects for that dataset.\nThe original reason for the Scene in the object hierarchy was to allow for using HueSpace for distributed rendering across multiple computers and monitors, which was a use case for an earlier version. For most modern HueSpace applications, referencing the Scene is just something done incidental to getting to the Project objects where the work is really done. It is normal to create a single scene but then to create multiple projects."

        "The lifetime of a HueSpace Proxy Object, generally created using one of the Create methods on the various manager types, must be explicitly managed by the client application, even in APIs that provide a garbage collection facility. Deleting a proxy object automatically deletes all child objects in the managers it owns; they need not be individually deleted. See also the documentation for Managers, which discusses explicitly managing the lifetime of Proxy Objects and links to references for deleting objects in each proxy API. \n\nThere are some objects accessible through the proxy APIs that are not Proxy Objects (i.e. they do not derive from that API's ProxyObject type and do not wrap an internal HueSpace object model object), so they are not covered by the rule above. Most such objects are related to the volume data access APIs. \n\nThe entry-point for those APIs is the VolumeDataAccessManager, accessible through e.g. VDS GetVolumeDataAccessManager in the C++ API. The VolumeDataAccessManager instance for a given VDS does NOT need to be explicitly deleted. The VolumeDataAccessManager may be used to create a number of other objects used to read/write VDS data:\n\n\u2022 <code>VolumeDataAccessManager::CreateVolumeDataPageAccessor</code> is used to created a <code>VolumeDataPageAccessor</code>, which MUST be deleted using DestroyVolumeDataPageAccessor\n\n\u2022 <code>VolumeDataPageAccessor::CreatePage</code> is used to create a <code>VolumeDataPage</code>, for which <code>VolumeDataPage::Release</code> MUST be called\n\n\u2022 There are many <code>VolumeDataAccessManager</code> methods used to create volume data accessors of various types (e.g. <code>CreateVolumeData2DInterpolatingAccessorR64</code>). These do not need to be explicitly deleted. However, the volume data accessor types are generally implemented using whatever scoped teardown / RAII mechanism is available in the target API so that read-write accessors automatically commit edits even if the Commit method is not explicitly called. For the C++ API, this happens through the normal destructor, for Python through with/as, for .NET through IDisposable / using, and for Java through AutoCloseable / try-with-resources."

        "Bluware Volume Data Store (VDS) is a powerful and flexible storage format for signal data. It was conceived more than 15 years ago to overcome the inherent limitations in existing formats, which were designed for tape storage. The architecture adopts concepts developed in the gaming industry where interactive performance is critical. VDS can support previously unachievable application workflows and end-user experiences.\n\nWhile VDS is generally known for storing seismic data, it is a generic storage system that is built to store any signal data types. For seismic data, VDS can store 2D, 3D, stacked, and pre-stack (migrated and raw gathers) seismic data.\n\nLearn about the capabilities of the storage format and the difference between the two available implementations, the open-source OpenVDS library and the commercial Bluware VDS implementation:\n\nVDS CAPABILITIES:\nVDS has many capabilities which are combined to provide flexibility and performance. It is important to understand these capabilities and the value that each capability delivers. This will also help define the differences between VDS, which is part of Bluware's commercial framework and OpenVDS which is available as open-source through the Open Subsurface Data Universe (OSD). For simplicity, these have been broken into three lifecycles: writing, storing and reading.

Although the spatial coordinate system is not a property of the VDS object itself, there is some support on the VolumeBox, SeismicLine and Horizon objects for setting up the position from VDSMetadata that follow a specific pattern. In order to position these objects according to the VDSMetadata of the VDS that is connected, the client application must call <code>GetVDSCoordinateSystem()</code> on the VolumeBox/Horizon or <code>GetVDSTraceCoordinates()</code> on the SeismicLine that should be positioned. It's also possible to get an <code>IJKGridDefinition</code> derived from the VDSMetadata from the VDS object by calling <code>GetIJKGridDefinitionFromVDSMetadata()</code>.\n\nThe VDS metadata provides the position of the first voxel (origin) in a 3D world coordinate system. It also provides the step vectors that define in which direction and how far the other voxels are positioned relative to the origin. Each step vector is related to a specific dimension of the VDS and is determined by a naming convention.\n\nThe VDS object annotates each dimension which has a number of samples with a name, a unit, starting and ending coordinate. For example, a seismic dataset with a certain number of samples in the time domain will annotate the trace dimension (typically dimension 0) with 'Time', 'ms', start time, end time.\n\nTwo families of VDS metadata for this category are described at KNOWNMETADATA_SURVEYCOORDINATESYSTEM.\n\n\u2022 Trace coordinate metadata:\nThis category contains VDSMetadataBLOBs that are populated with <code>GetVDSTraceCoordinates()</code> method.

Doing so would delete or invalidate the existing VDS cache file on the network drive. You will need to produce a new local VDS cache file instead.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to create a local VDS cache file given another VDS cache file.\n\nYou could simply copy the VDS cache file from the network drive to the local drive, outside of HueSpace, then restore the VDS from the new local cache file. This is a synchronous approach that requires you to finish the file copy before restoring the VDS.\n\nAlternatively, you could create a pass-through VDS in HueSpace that takes the original VDS (restored from the VDS cache file on the slow network drive) as input and forwards the input VDS data to its own output, then cache and seal the pass-through VDS to a new local VDS cache file. This may be done asynchronously, where HueSpace populates the cache file in the background while you are also potentially requesting data from the VDS as needed (which then also gets cached).\n\nHueSpace ships with a pass-through VDSFilter plugin. The plugin will copy all channels, or a given selection of channels, from the input VDS. The output will have the same voxel format and components as the input."

        "Prefetching a VDS is synonymous with Caching it to a file on disk. The terms are used interchangeably.\n\nPrior to caching a VDS to disk, you must ensure that the various caching-related sub-objects are set as desired, either that their default values are correct or they have been explicitly set to the correct values. The caching-related sub-objects include CacheFileName, the various CacheDimensions_* flags that determine whether each dimension group should be cached, CompressionMethod and CompressionTolerance if applicable. Changing any of those values after caching has started will invalidate the cache file and cancel the caching process.\n\nOnce the cache file sub-objects are set as desired, caching is generally initiated by setting the VDS PrefetchMode to VDSPrefetchMode::Once. You then know caching is complete when the PrefetchMode changes back to <code>VDSPrefetchMode::Off</code>. If you want to cache the entire file synchronously, you can use <code>Hue::ProxyLib::IProxyInterface::RunUntil</code> with a condition that checks whether the VDS PrefetchMode has been set to <code>VDSPrefetchMode::Off</code>.\n\nWhile a VDS is being cached, it may be useful to handle the CachedOnDiskFactor changed event to output progress or update a progress bar. The VDS CachedOnDiskFactor ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 as the caching process runs. It may also be useful to periodically output the PrefetchStatus, which reports how long caching has taken so far and provides an estimate of the time remaining.\n\nIf an error occurs while caching, the VDS StatusMessage event will be raised with a non-zero error code. It may be useful to record such errors for reporting after the caching process stops. Additionally, VDS has a LastFileError sub-object that specifically records the last disk error that was encountered while reading or writing data to disk. If any error is encountered, caching will be canceled and PrefetchMode set to VDSPrefetchMode::Off.\n\nWarning:\nChecking for VDS CachedOnDiskFactor equal to 1.0 may seem equivalent to checking for PrefetchMode equal to <code>VDSPrefetchMode::Off</code>, but there are subtle differences because of the timing of when HueSpace updates each one. It is also possible that PrefetchMode changes to <code>VDSPrefetchMode::Off</code> because of an error during caching, which would prevent CachedOnDiskFactor from ever reaching 1.0. So checking for VDS PrefetchMode to equal <code>VDSPrefetchMode::Off</code> is a more robust approach."

        "A VDS dataset is defined by a set of axes, each having a name, unit and number of samples, that determines the dimensionality (up to 6D) of the VDS, and a set of data channels, each having a name, unit and data format, that determine which values are stored for each position in the VDS. A VDS also has a base brick size (see below) and a setting for how many level-of-detail (LOD) downsampled versions of the data there are.\n\nThere is always at least one channel, the primary channel, and it always has the same dimensionality as the number of axes of the VDS. The VDS might also have additional channels, these channels can optionally ignore the first axis of the VDS and instead store a fixed number of values (most commonly a single value). Additional channels can also specify that they do not have LODs as it is not all data types that are meaningful to downsample.\n\nThe data in a VDS is organized into layers, which is the data for a specific channel with a specific LOD and a specific partitioning into chunks. Chunks are 3D bricks or 2D tiles that can be serialized using different compression methods (including no compression) and are stored as individual objects in the cloud, or in a container file. The VDS formats support multiple partitionings of the same data into chunks, e.g. the data can be stored as both 3D bricks and 2D tiles to allow for faster access to slices of the data at the cost of increased storage requirements.\n\nThe format also specifies how metadata, key-value pairs pertaining to the VDS as a whole, is stored. There is a set of known metadata that applications using VDS for a specific purpose (e.g. to store seismic data) are expected to follow, both required metadata and additional optional metadata that can be used to store information that allows re-creating the original data (e.g. SEG-Y file or other proprietary formats) exactly.\n\nThe description of the partitioning of the data and all related metadata is encoded in the JSON format (The JSON Data Interchange Format, 2017), thus it can easily be interpreted using a variety of programming languages and technologies. Each chunk of data is serialized in one of several available binary serialization methods, all of which have open source deserialization code available.\n\nLayers:\nEach multi-dimensional array of data is called a layer, there will be one layer for each partitioning of each LOD of each data channel in the dataset. The partitioning of a layer into 3D bricks or 2D tiles is done with respect to a dimension group which defines which dimensions of the multi-dimensional array are the 3 dimensions of the bricks. For example a 4D array can be partitioned into 3D bricks that are either including the 012 dimensions of the 4D array, or the 013 dimensions or the 023 dimensions or the 123 dimensions.\n\nThe name of a layer is formed by appending channel name + dimension group + LOD, and for the primary channel of the dataset the channel name is omitted from the layer name. An example layer name is Dimensions_012LOD0 for the 012 dimension group of the primary channel at LOD 0. See figure_layers for an illustration of how a seismic poststack dataset is organized.\n\nChunks:\nChunk data formats supported include 32- and 64-bit floating point values, 8- and 16-bit unsigned integers with a scale and offset (which can be used to represent quantized floating-point values), 32- and 64-bit unsigned integers, and 1-bit Boolean values. Null/no-values are fully supported.\n\nChunks can be uncompressed or compressed with a range of compression options, including wavelet compression (lossy or lossless), zipped, or run-length encoding. Constant value chunks are marked as such in the index of the dataset and do not need to be stored explicitly, so sparse volumes are represented in an efficient way.\n\nThe base brick size of a 3D brick is always a power-of-two (64, 128, 256 etc.), and bricks always have the same size in each dimension. 2D tiles have a size that is a multiple (usually 4 times) of the base brick size in order to reduce the overhead of having a lot of separate objects.\n\nChunk metadata:\nTo enable sparse datasets to be efficiently represented, as well as chunk compression methods that can use adaptive/progressive compression (i.e. use a prefix of the serialized chunk data to produce a lower-quality version of the chunk), we can have a small amount of extra binary data (typically 8-40 bytes for each chunk) that are available as a 1D array divided into pages of a fixed number of chunk entries.\n\nThe interpretation of this chunk-metadata is dictated by the serialization method for the layer in question. The 8 first bytes is the volume data hash which is used to detect duplicates. It does not have to be a real hash of the data, the only requirement is that if the volume data hash of two chunks is identical we can assume the data stored for that chunk is the same. Chunk-metadata page entries with a value of 0 indicate a chunk has not been written, and this is not a legal volume data hash. There are special values of the volume data hash to indicate the whole chunk is NoValue (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) or constant (first 4 bytes is an IEEE floating point value, next 4 bytes is 0x01010101). For wavelet compressed data a small table is stored in the next 16 bytes where each byte represents how many 255ths of the size of the previous level (starting with the size of the full object) are required in order to decompress that quality level."

We call this the novalue-value.\n\nSet the <code>Hue::ProxyLib::VDS::NoValue</code> property on the VDS to the novalue-value, and enable the <code>Hue::ProxyLib::VDS::UseNoValue</code> property.\n\nReplace NaN with the novalue-value when populating the VDS.\n\nWhen requesting data from the VDS, use the replacementNoValue argument to specify that NaNs should be returned when the VDS contains the novalue-value.

        "Overview\nHueSpace is a framework and computational engine for performing computation and visualization on extremely large datasets. It can be thought of as a Core Engine that combines:\n\n\u2022 Data\n\u2022 Compute\n\u2022 Visualization\n\nThe design of HueSpace is driven by the demands of the oil and gas industry, but most of the concepts are domain-independent.\n\nHueSpace provides two distinct APIs for developing applications:\n\nThe Proxy API, which is used for integrating into the client application and orchestrating computations\n\nThe Plugin API, which is used to provide new algorithms to import and process volumetric or shape data\n\nA client application may use HueSpace directly, or it may go through the Headwave Platform APIs to use domain-specific objects for oil and gas. An application may use the various algorithms (provided as plug-ins) that ship with HueSpace itself, and it may also provide its own. Most applications will also use a multitude of other libraries, and HueSpace is able to coexist alongside those other libraries.\n\nDesign Principles\nSimplicity\nClient applications should be able to utilize all HueSpace functionality just by using a simple, high-level API. It should be possible to create extensible applications using parallel (possibly multi-GPU), out-of-core processing and state-of-the-art visualization without having to deal with low-level details.\n\nPull-based Dataflow Pipeline\nAll HueSpace computations are lazy; an object performs its computation only if another object requests the result. In other words, the object's inputs and parameters can be fully configured, but if there is no object that uses the output of the computation, no work at all is performed. This default behavior gives HueSpace a 'pull' model for data production, which drives data through processing pipelines on demand; that is, only as it is needed for computation, visualization, or direct client access.\n\nRetained Mode State Machine\nHueSpace contains a complete model of the objects to be computed and rendered. Client calls do not directly trigger computations or rendering, but rather modify state in the internal object model. HueSpace can thus optimize when the actual computations or visualization takes place.\n\nPrimary and Transient State\nThe complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in HueSpace is hidden from client application developers. Primary state, designed to be manipulated, is exposed, while transient state is hidden away inside HueSpace.\n\nTechnology Architecture\nHueSpace is exclusively written in cross platform C++, with minimal third-party dependencies. The Core Engine is multi-threaded, and it utilizes OpenMP and optionally NVIDIA CUDA for accelerating computations. The visualization system is built on OpenGL. For specific system requirements see System Requirements.\n\nProxy API\nWhen integrating HueSpace into end-user applications, all access to the internal Object Model goes through the Proxy API. This API is currently provided for:\n\n\u2022 C++\n\u2022.NET (usually used through C#)\n\u2022 Python\n\u2022 Java\n\nFor each of these languages, the API and documentation are automatically generated from the internal Object Model. This ensures that the APIs are always updated and kept in sync. The generated APIs aspire to be conservative in their version requirements for each target language, so that HueSpace can be integrated into existing applications without mandating other changes to technology stacks that are already deployed.\n\nEach Proxy API is designed to feel native for its target language. In languages such as .NET and Python, sub-objects are exposed using properties instead of more explicit get/set function calls, and native event mechanisms are used. Collection interfaces are implemented in the .NET and Java APIs, while iterators are supported in the C++ API to allow use with the STL. Bulk data is provided as NumPy arrays in the Python API.\n\nNote that all of the Proxy APIs may be used concurrently to access the same object model. So you could have a .NET front-end with a C++ back-end that also exposes Python scripting capability, or any other combination that makes sense for the technical problem at hand.\n\nPlugin API\nCompute plugins written in C++ (optionally using CUDA) may be used to extend the HueSpace Core Engine with new data sources and algorithms. This plugin API is very different from the object model proxy API, and different rules apply to them, see the Compute Plugin Developer Guide for more details.\n\nUser Interface\nViewer UI libraries are provided for C++ (Qt) and .NET (WinForms, WPF). These libraries provide widgets that create and maintain the OpenGL context that will be provided to HueSpace for rendering, as well as implement basic handling for mouse, keyboard, etc.\n\nDeployment\nHueSpace is delivered as a collection of components which include:\n\n\u2022 The core native C++ library, whose architecture is described in Architecture and Technology Details\n\u2022 Proxy API libraries in various languages, which provide customized language-specific access to the functionality provided by the core library\n\u2022 Viewer UI libraries for C++ (Qt) and .NET (WinForms, WPF)\n\u2022 A collection of plug-ins for processing volumetric data and shapes\n\nThere are several ways in which HueSpace can be used within a host application:\n\n\u2022 Direct OpenGL can be used by providing HueSpace with an existing OpenGL context maintained by e.g. WinForms or Qt.\n\u2022 Integration with other frameworks such as OpenInventor, where support is provided by means of the OpenInventor node, allowing for HueSpace rendering to be embedded within any OpenInventor scene graph.\n\u2022 Headless/Text-Only It is possible to use HueSpace in a completely non-interactive fashion, e.g. for batch processing or import jobs. CUDA can optionally be used if a GPU is present, but access to a GPU is not a requirement. The VDSPrefetch Tool described elsewhere is an example of such an application."

        "HueSpace provides a caching system for VDS processing carried out on the GPU. To summarize, each physical GPU on the system that is enabled for use with HueSpace will be associated with a particular VDS processing thread. The ConfigMemoryManagement sub-objects ProcessingGPUCacheMax[0-7] define how much GPU memory HueSpace is allowed to use for the processing GPU cache (in megabytes) for each processing thread with a GPU enabled. If the processing GPU cache for a processing thread reaches its ProcessingGPUCacheMax[0-7], HueSpace will attempt to free space in that processing GPU cache by removing the least recently used cache items.\n\nThe HueSpace GPU processing caching system tries to ensure that there is no sustained memory usage above the configured max for a GPU, and this works when HueSpace is aware of all of the GPU memory allocated for VDS data production. However, for plugin-based VDS objects, it is possible that plugin processing functions make use of external libraries that allocate their own GPU CUDA memory. In such cases, it is useful to make HueSpace aware of this externally allocated CUDA memory so that it may be taken into account for the overall CUDA memory required for the plugin. This may be done in plugin BeginProcessing using the provided ResourceAllocationInterface instance's AddExternalCUDAMemoryPressure.\n\nExternal CUDA memory pressure recorded through AddExternalCUDAMemoryPressure will count against the ProcessingGPUCacheMax[0-7] for the GPU processing thread that the plugin instance is running on, which means that it is treated in an equivalent manner as HueSpace allocated GPU CUDA memory when it comes to deciding whether to remove the least recently used cache items to ensure memory usage stays below the configured max.\n\nYou generally do not need to do anything else, as external CUDA memory pressure is automatically removed by HueSpace after the call to plugin EndProcessing"

You can experiment with combinations of the networks and the loss functions to train your models as they generally are all able to generate high quality results for most datasets.\n\nThe following network architectures can be used for training or validation:\n\n\u2022 U-Net - the same network architecture used previously in version 3.4 that uses a small sample of patches during training. It has more parameters than ENet and, therefore, is prone to over-fitting when trained for a long time.\n\u2022 E-Net -a new network architecture that uses a larger sample of patches during training. E-Nets can take -(~50%) longer to train per epoch, but typically produce higher quality results than U-Net.\n\nThe following types of loss functions are available for training:\n\nNote: Weighted Root Mean Square Error (WRMSE) and Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE) are only available for binary and multiclass layers, respectively.\n\n\u2022 WRMSE - binary only. The same loss function used in all v3.4 layers. WRMSE tends to make aggressive predictions and generate ample false positives, particularly in early epochs. If you look for more predictions than what you labeled, WRMSE is certainly the one to choose. On the flip side, the inference results may not look very clean due to the false positives. WRMSE is a good starting point for detection of all geological features when you first work on your data and have not many labels.\n\u2022 CCE - multiclass only.\n\u2022 Dice - works by maximizing the similarity areas between prediction results and labels.\n\u2022 Focal - is an extension of the cross-entropy loss function that would focus training on hard negatives examples and down-weight easy examples.\n\u2022 Mix of Focal and Dice - tends to make conservative predictions and is prone to false negatives. For example, it may make several fault segments rather than a long, continuous fault. On the other hand, because of the conservative nature, it is a good choice for training geobodies in poor, low S/N data without making too many unwanted false positive predictions. This is a good starting point for multiclass layers focused on stratigraphy.\n\nGeneral Recommendations\n\u2022 For binary faults, the combination of ENet and Weighted RMSE may yield better results than others.\n\u2022 For binary geobodies (e.g., salt), the combination of ENet and mix of Focal and Dice may yield better results than others.\n\u2022 For multiclass layers of only stratigraphy, the combination of ENet and mix of Focal and Dice may yield better results than others.\n\u2022 For multiclass layers of mix of stratigraphy and faults or other significantly less represented features, the combination of ENet and mix of Focal and Dice may yield better results than others."

A fault spanning a number of inlines or crosslines that are less than the multiplication of the Inline Stick Spacing or the Crossline Stick Spacing and the Minimum Sticks will not be generated in the output. For example, when setting Minimum Sticks = 10, Inline Stick Spacing = 5, and Crossline Stick Spacing = 5, it will remove faults that span less than 50 inlines/crosslines.\n\n\nThe fault sticks will only be generated on the inline/crossline numbers = Inline Stick Spacing * N + Inline/Crossline Stick Start, in which N is an integer.

Due to the smoothing effect applied to the probability scanner cube, the highest probabilities are less than 1 in the probability scanner cube, whereas the highest is equal to 1 in the original probability cube.\n\nWhen faults have large widths on the intersection between the faults and horizontal slices, the intersection tends to have multiple highest probability values around the center of the faults and the algorithms tend to struggle to make smooth centerlines connecting those highest probability voxels.

To improve this, increase the Gaussian Half-Width as shown in the example.\n\nIncreasing the Gaussian Half-Width will lower the overall probabilities in the probability scanner cube.

        "Input masks can be used to restrict training to a specific interval or to exclude certain features from the training of a different feature, for example, faulted zones using fault probability as the input mask. Stratigraphic zone isolation and generating faulted zone grids are two examples of effective use of input masks.\n\nThe workflow is:\n\n\u2022 Conduct a standard multiclass deep learning workflow to generate a Deep Learning layer to use as an input mask\n\u2022 Create a new deep learning layer and select the multiclass deep learning layer as an input mask. Turn ON the classes to use as a mask. When you view the new deep learning layer, the input mask will be applied to the visualized data as a gray overlay - data covered by this overlay will be excluded from the training process.\n\u2022 Train the model normally; when you check inference you will notice there are no predictions in the masked area.\n\n<img>static/images/inputmask1.png</img>\n\n<img>static/images/inputmask2.png</img>"

        "You can create and use a vertical mask to constrain learning to data inside the vertical mask polygon. The vertical mask will help the deep learning network to focus on the area of interest and produce better results and can significantly reduce the probability cube generation process time.\n\n1. Click + on the Static Data toolbar, or on the desired Static Data group to open the Create Layer dialog, and select Vertical Mask Layer from the pulldown.  \n\nNote: If you click + on the Static Data Toolbar, you can create a group that contains the vertical mask. Toggle the Create New Group and Static Group to ON, and type a Static Group Name. Otherwise, toggle Create New Group and Static Group to OFF (left) and a new group will not be created.\n\n<img>static/images/createvmlayer_564x435.png</img>\n\n2. Enter the desired layer name.\n\n3. If you want the mask to define the area to include, change the Mask toggle to Mask is outside region. To define the area you want to exclude, change the Mask toggle to Mask is inside region. This can be changed as you define the masks and draw the polygons. \n\n4. Click Apply Mask.\n\n5. The view will change to slice. The new mask layer will not be added to the Layers pane until the polygons are created and accepted.     \n\n6. The vertical mask layer definition tool will be active; use it like the fault tool to define the mask area. Click once to place the first anchor point, then again for successive points on the fault trace. Right-click to accept the points and the outline, or press CTRL+Z  to undo segments.\n\n<img>static/images/vertmask1_900x658.png</img>\n\nNote: You can draw multiple polygons. Overlapping polygons will be merged into one polygon. Polygons with intersecting lines may have unexpected results.\n\n7. You can select whether the mask includes or excludes the defined area by using the Mask toggle.\n<img>static/images/vminclude_418x404.png</img>\nMask includes selected area (dark pink) \n\n<img>static/images/vmexclude_429x408.png</img>\nMask excludes selected area (dark pink)\n\nIf you want the mask to define the area to include, change the Mask toggle to Mask is outside region. To define the area you want to exclude, change the Mask toggle to Mask is inside region. This can be changed as you define the masks and draw the polygons.\n\n8. Click Accept to accept the mask. The vertical mask layer is created and can be as a vertical mask for deep learning layers.\n\n9. You can update the mask by selecting the vertical mask layer, and adding or deleting the last polygon that was accepted. If you have multiple polygons, you can click Remove Last Polygon to remove the last polygon that was created in order. You can click Remove Last Polygon to remove as many polygons as is necessary. You can add new polygons as desired.\n<img>static/images/vertmask2_900x610.png</img>\n\n10. Click Accept to update the Vertical Mask after making your changes.\n\nTo apply the vertical mask, open the Layer Properties for the desired deep learning network, and select the desired mask to use in the Vertical Mask list."

        "Labels can be drawn when a label layer or a Deep Learning layer is active. Label information for deep learning layers is stored in the linked label layer.\nLabel features using the appropriate tools. Paint simple initial labels on features that are well-imaged in the seismic, then add more complex labels using feedback from the deep learning layer.\nNote: When working on large datasets, the labeling may become slow. When this happens, the backend process is busy, but all commands from the labeling will be cached, and the Undo function may work unpredictably. Be patient when labeling large datasets or using Undo.\n\n<img>static/images/trainingfaults_900x422.png</img>\n\nFor best results, follow these recommendations:\n1. Make sure that the brush weight is not too heavy (wide) so that too much surrounding data is picked, or too light (narrow) so that not enough information on each side of the feature is labeled. The labels should capture event terminations on both sides of the feature to work optimally.\nNote: If you have overlapping labels, labeling using the Fault Picker and using CTRL-Z more than once may remove some of the intersections of the labels. You can paint any missing label using the Brush tool.\n2. Click the Training icon (<img>static/images/trainingicon.png</img>) to start training.\nTraining for layers with a large amount of labels or complex labeling can take up to one minute to initialize. The screen will show the progress bar as static until training is fully initialized. After the first epoch, training will speed up noticeably.\n3. A training progress bar will appear above the screen. when the training bar reaches the right end of the screen, it has completed a training epoch.\nNote: If the progress bar bounces back and forth but training will not start, turn training Off, wait a few seconds, then turn training back On. Training will only run if the network status indicator in the upper right corner of the UI is green. If the status indicator is yellow, that indicates the network is still busy computing inference or TensorFlow is not yet ready to run.\n4. Inference will be automatically displayed. It may take one to two epochs before inference displays.\nNote: If Inference does not display after 10 seconds, stop the training process and refresh the browser.\n5. You can refine the predictions by adding label information to or removing label information from accepted inference as appropriate.\nInference is accepted on a line-by-line basis, meaning that accepting the inference on an inline will convert the inference to labels on that line only, not throughout the entire volume. Use the labeling and editing tools to reinforce or remove parts of labels that were converted from the inference. The network will use the corrections as additional data points in training and will adjust the inferences appropriately.\nNote: Accepting inference is not recommended for networks training for faults or similar feature types.\n6. Once the inference is to your satisfaction, use the slider bar or direct entry to specify another line. Try to label lines with different seismic expression so that the network will have more data to train with.\nNote: The lines that have been labeled will display on the slider bar as green tick marks.\n7. Check different lines that do not have labels to see how accurate the network inferences are. Interact as appropriate with the inference to reinforce network learning."
